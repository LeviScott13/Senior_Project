                        <p style="padding-right: 100px; font-size: 13px"> We live in a world with AI controlled/operated surveillance equipment built into every facet of our public lives. <br>
                                        This wouldn’t be a problem in and of itself if the AI were unbiased, and those who had access to them were 
                                        paragons of civic virtue. As computer scientists, we know that it is impossible to make an unbiased AI on data 
                                        gathered from the real world, as all data describing a society is inherently biased. Data gathered from a biased 
                                        source will lead to biased conclusions. Powerful tools are in the hands of those who may not use them appropriately. 
                                        Even if they are used correctly now, different groups will have control over those tools in the future, and may 
                                        utilize them with malicious intent. A license plate scanner that is attached to a database may be used to search for 
                                        those with arrest warrants in a parking lot. They can also be used to create complete travel maps for an individual,
                                        as well as track connections between that individual and every person they meet. A facial detection system built into 
                                        streetlamps could theoretically be used to prevent crime, but we have seen it used in China to implement a Social
                                        Credit system that persecutes minorities and those in opposition to the CPP. AI tools are powerful, and they are
                                        being implemented in ways that do more harm to the people they are meant to serve than good. Individuals who live 
                                        in societies that utilize AI powered surveillance tools have little power to stop the usage of those tools. However,
                                        they can utilize camouflage to prevent the AI tools from being effective. There exist clothing options today that can 
                                        be used to fool a variety of types of detection AI, but they haven’t been widely adopted. The reasons for this are 
                                        simple: they are ugly, non-personal, obtrusive, and usually are made without a specific AI in mind. This means that 
                                        for any specific surveillance system, there are very few articles that could be used to subvert it. This makes it
                                        difficult for those who care about privacy to utilize them, and the inaccessibility of tools to make custom articles
                                        makes it difficult to create their own. Further, by not having a large pool of such articles available, there is no 
                                        chance of the designs being taken into the mainstream fashion and design worlds. </br></br>
                                        In summary, the problems we will be addressing are that:

                        <p style="padding-right: 100px; font-size: 13px"> Our group plans to create a web-interface based product that will allow users to create and test their
                                        own designs against a suite of different forms of detection AI. The users will need no knowledge of how
                                        the system works, as it will be created with users unfamiliar with computers in mind. The user will first
                                        select the type of AI they are attempting to subvert (face detection, license plate, edge detection, etc).
                                        The interface will feature a cloth design section, where they will be able to upload their own design elements.
                                        This cloth will be digitally cut and combined into the shape of a T-shirt, and that T-shirt will be added to
                                        a digital mannequin for the user to examine and tweak. The user will then submit the design for verification
                                        against the AI selected. In a fully automatic process, several images of the article will be taken from different
                                        angles. These images will be sent to our server, which will run the relevant AI against them. A rating will then
                                        be returned, depending on the criteria the request to the server was made with. This will allow the user to know
                                        if their design will work without having to make a physical prototype and try it against a system they have access
                                        to. As a result, the ability to regain privacy will be made available to anyone who has a few minutes to make
                                        something that they think looks good.</br></br>
